# NBSVM
SInce I still receive a good number of emails 4 years later,
I decided to put this code on github and write the
instructions better. The code is still just as bad.

For technical details see [our paper](wang12simple.pdf) and
[our talk](wang12simple_slides.pdf).

```
@inproceedings{wang12simple, 
author = {Wang, Sida I. and Manning, Christopher D.}, 
booktitle = {Proceedings of the ACL}, 
title = {Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification}, 
year = {2012}, 
booktitle = {ACL (2)}, 
pages = {90-94} 
} 
```

## Running NBSVM
- Download the data and override the empty data directory in root: "data/rt10662/unigram_rts.mat"
- Go to src and run the script master.m to produce the results from the paper
- Results and details are logged in resultslog.txt and details.txt, respectively
- A table with all the results is printed to the screen

## The data
-
  [data](http://www.stanford.edu/~sidaw/projects/data_NB_ACL12.zip) - 404.4MB includes all the data
-
  [data_small](http://www.stanford.edu/~sidaw/projects/datasmall_NB_ACL12.zip) - 108.5MB
  data_small = data_all - large_IMDB

- For each data set, there is a corresponding folder data/$DatasetName.
- You can find $FeatureType_$DatasetName.mat in data/$DatasetName, where
$FeatureType is unigram or bigram.
- data/$DatasetName/cv_obj.mat determines the standard evaluation for each dataset (how many
  folds, whats the split, etc.). They are generated by corresponding
  data processing script in src/misc

## Notes and comments
- The datasets are collected by others, please cite the original sources if you work with them
- The data structure used kept the order information of the document, instead of
converting to bag-of-words vector right away. This resulted in some
unnecessary mess for this work, but might make it easier if you want
to try a more complex model.
- While many experiments have been ran for this task, performance is
  really all about regularization, and even the simplest model (Naive
  Bayes) would fit the training set perfectly. As far as I know, there is no good
  theory for why things even work in this case of non-sparse weights
  and p>>n.
- Despite a number of highly cited papers that experimented on these same
  datasets, I'm unsure if any of the complicated, deep learning models
  today are doing significantly more than bag of words.
  Available ompute power, engineering competence in addition to that no one
  tries very hard anymore pushing
  linear classifiers are some causes for concern.
- These models run in seconds or less, and
  behaves predictably for a different test distribution.
- Another [example](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02167) of bag of words going strong.
